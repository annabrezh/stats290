This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

## Overview

annna is a package intended to work with the Open FDA Developer Challenger data. It includes a set of 
functions to make working with this data easy in the following ways:

* `queryOpenFDA(limit)` will query the drug adverse events database and return the number of results as set by limit within a dataframe. See `?queryOpenFDA` for more details


Install the package by downloading the annna directory and using
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(annna)
```

Load the project Report and view usage of functions by using
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("Report", package = "annna")
```

```{r}
plotDrugAdverseEvents
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
